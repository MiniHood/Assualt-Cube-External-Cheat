# Assualt-Cube-External-Cheat

I'm currently learning C++ and game cheating. This cheat uses offsets to modify the player's speed and jump height in the game.


This code should be used for educational purposes only. Writing and using cheats is not condoned and can lead to consequences in online games.

Obviously change all offsets and obviously fake numbers to new and real offsets and real process ids.
